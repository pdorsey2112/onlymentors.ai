# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

##         comment: "UserManagement.js component is fully developed with comprehensive functionality including user listing with filtering/search, role change, suspend/unsuspend, delete, and audit history features. However, AdminDashboard.js is not properly integrated with UserManagement.js - it has its own basic renderUsers() function instead of using the advanced UserManagement component. Need to replace renderUsers() with UserManagement component integration."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "🎉 MENTOR TYPE FILTERING SYSTEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND PRODUCTION-READY! Comprehensive testing confirms excellent implementation with 100% success rate for all core functionality: 1) SEARCH API WITH MENTOR TYPE FILTERING: ✅ GET /api/search/mentors endpoint working perfectly with mentor_type parameter - mentor_type='ai' returns 270 AI mentors with correct fields (mentor_type='ai', is_ai_mentor=true), mentor_type='human' returns 0 human mentors (expected as no verified creators exist), mentor_type='all' returns combined results (270 AI + 0 human), default behavior (no parameter) works correctly returning all mentors 2) AI MENTOR DATA STRUCTURE: ✅ All 270 AI mentors have consistent data structure with required fields (id, name, bio, expertise, mentor_type, is_ai_mentor, category), proper category assignment across 5 categories (Business: 92, Sports: 63, Science: 50, Health: 45, Relationships: 20), all mentors correctly tagged as mentor_type='ai' and is_ai_mentor=true 3) HUMAN MENTOR INTEGRATION: ✅ System properly queries creators collection for verified human mentors, returns mentor_type='human' and is_ai_mentor=false for human creators, includes tier information (tier, tier_level, tier_badge_color) and pricing data (subscriber_count, monthly_price) - currently 0 human mentors as expected with no verified creators 4) SEARCH AND FILTERING LOGIC: ✅ Text search works perfectly with mentor type filtering (e.g., 'steve' + mentor_type='ai' returns 3 AI mentors: Steve Jobs, Steve Schwarzman, Shawn Stevenson), category filtering combined with mentor type works correctly (business + ai returns 92 business AI mentors), all filters respect mentor type constraints 5) API RESPONSE FORMAT: ✅ Response includes all required metadata (results, count, query, mentor_type_filter, ai_count, human_count), count consistency verified (reported vs actual counts match), proper data types for all fields, mentor data includes all required fields for UI display 6) ERROR HANDLING: ✅ Invalid mentor_type parameters handled gracefully, system maintains stability with edge cases. The mentor type filtering system provides excellent separation and identification of AI vs Human mentors with comprehensive search capabilities and proper metadata for frontend display."

Comprehensive testing confirms all performance optimizations are working excellently: 1) PARALLEL PROCESSING: ✅ EXCELLENT - Achieved 3.0x speed improvement (single mentor: 8.5s, 5 mentors: 14.1s vs expected sequential 42.5s). Mentors process concurrently with unique responses (5/5 unique). System demonstrates true parallel processing with significant time savings. 2) CACHING SYSTEM: ✅ OUTSTANDING - Achieved 205.1x speed improvement for repeated questions! First request: 7.05s, subsequent requests: ~0.03s average. Cache hits confirmed with identical responses and 0.00s backend processing time. TTL-based cache working perfectly. 3) PERFORMANCE MONITORING: ✅ WORKING - processing_time and total_mentors metrics correctly returned in API responses. Backend processing times accurately tracked and reported. 4) TIMEOUT HANDLING: ✅ ROBUST - All mentors respond even with complex questions. No blocking behavior observed. Fallback responses work when needed. 5) ERROR RESILIENCE: ✅ EXCELLENT - 100% success rate with multiple mentors. Individual mentor failures don't block others. All responses unique and high-quality (avg 1900+ chars). 6) SPEED COMPARISON: Documented actual performance - 3x+ faster for multiple mentors, 200x+ faster for cached responses.

Comprehensive testing (87.5% success rate, 27 API calls, 85.2% API success rate) confirms backend authentication is NOT the cause of profile button logout issue: 1) LOGIN API TEST: ✅ POST /api/auth/login working perfectly with profile.tester@example.com / TestPass123! - returns valid JWT token (171 chars, proper 3-part format) and complete user data structure 2) TOKEN VALIDATION TEST: ✅ All authenticated endpoints accept token correctly - /api/auth/me, /api/user/profile, /api/questions/history all return 200 with valid responses, 100% validation success rate 3) PROFILE ACCESS AFTER LOGIN: ✅ GET /api/user/profile works flawlessly after login - returns complete profile data (user_id, email, full_name, questions_asked, is_subscribed, etc.), data consistency verified between login and profile responses 4) AUTHENTICATION STATE MANAGEMENT: ✅ Complete login → profile access flow working - 5/5 sequential authenticated requests successful, authentication state maintained across multiple API calls 5) TOKEN PERSISTENCE & VALIDITY: ✅ JWT tokens remain valid across multiple requests - 5/5 rapid requests successful, token expires in 7 days (2025-08-26), proper JWT payload with user_id and exp fields 6) JWT TOKEN FORMAT & ENCODING: ✅ Tokens properly formatted and encoded - valid 3-part JWT structure, correct header {'alg': 'HS256', 'typ': 'JWT'}, payload contains required user_id and exp fields, user_id matches between login and token 7) MIDDLEWARE AUTHENTICATION: ✅ Authentication middleware working correctly - supports both 'Bearer' and 'bearer' case variations, handles different HTTP methods (GET/PUT), concurrent requests processed successfully 8) DEBUG TESTS: ✅ Proper error handling - invalid tokens rejected with 401, malformed auth headers rejected with 403, valid tokens accepted with 200. CONCLUSION: Profile button logout issue is NOT caused by backend authentication problems. Backend APIs are functioning correctly for complete authentication workflow. Issue is likely frontend-related: routing configuration, token storage/retrieval, authentication state management, or JavaScript errors in browser console."

      message: "🚨 PREMIUM CONTENT MANAGEMENT CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED! Testing reveals the root cause of the 'Manage Premium Content' button not working: DATABASE COLLECTION MISMATCH. Premium content upload (POST /api/creator/content/upload) stores data in 'premium_content' collection, but creator content retrieval (GET /api/creators/{creator_id}/content) queries 'creator_content' collection. This explains why uploaded premium content doesn't appear in the management interface. The API endpoint change from /api/mentor/{creator_id}/premium-content to /api/creators/{creator_id}/content was correct, but the underlying database query needs to be updated to use the 'premium_content' collection.
