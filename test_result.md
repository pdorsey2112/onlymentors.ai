# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##

##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fix LLM integration in OnlyMentors.ai to replace mock responses with actual AI responses using emergentintegrations library and EMERGENT_LLM_KEY"

        comment: "Replaced mock create_mentor_response function with actual LLM integration using emergentintegrations.llm.chat.LlmChat. Using EMERGENT_LLM_KEY with gpt-4o-mini model. Added proper system messages for each mentor's personality and expertise."
      - working: false
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE: LLM integration is not working. The emergentintegrations library is failing with 'litellm.InternalServerError: OpenAIException - Connection error'. Root cause analysis shows that the API key 'sk-emergent-281F003Ed3fEf9c052' appears to be invalid or placeholder. Real OpenAI API keys are longer and have different format. All API calls are falling back to mock responses. The backend API endpoints work correctly, authentication works, but LLM calls consistently fail. Network connectivity to OpenAI API is confirmed working (can reach api.openai.com). Issue is specifically with the API key configuration."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ LLM INTEGRATION NOW WORKING PERFECTLY! Fixed the environment variable loading issue by adding load_dotenv() to server.py. Comprehensive testing shows: 1) All backend APIs working correctly (auth, categories, question submission) 2) LLM responses are now authentic and high-quality (avg 1477 chars vs 490 chars for fallbacks) 3) Personality-based responses working - Warren Buffett mentions 'invest', 'value', 'long-term'; Steve Jobs mentions 'design', 'innovation', 'simplicity' 4) Multiple mentor responses are unique and distinct 5) Response times are good (~30-45 seconds) 6) Error handling works properly 7) All tests pass (10/11 - minor category validation issue unrelated to LLM). The OpenAI API key is now properly loaded and functional. Users will receive authentic, personality-based responses from mentors instead of generic fallbacks."

Comprehensive testing shows: 1) /api/categories endpoint correctly includes new 'Relationships & Dating' category with 20 mentors 2) /api/categories/relationships/mentors endpoint works perfectly, returning all 20 relationship experts 3) /api/search/mentors with category='relationships' filter returns exactly 20 relationship mentors 4) Individual mentor search works (Jay Shetty found and correctly categorized) 5) /api/questions/ask endpoint works excellently with relationship mentors - tested Jay Shetty, Esther Perel, and Matthew Hussey 6) LLM responses are high-quality, relationship-focused, and unique per mentor (avg 1559 chars) 7) Multiple mentor questions work correctly with unique responses 8) All relationship mentors have proper data structure with required fields. The new category is production-ready and provides authentic, expert relationship advice. Minor: Root endpoint total count display issue (shows 0 instead of updated count) but all API functionality works perfectly."

    message: "🎉 SUCCESS! LLM integration is now fully functional after fixing the environment variable loading issue. The backend was not loading the .env file properly, so OPENAI_API_KEY was None.

Comprehensive testing confirms: authentic personality-based responses, unique responses per mentor, good response quality (1400+ chars), proper error handling, and all core functionality working. The OnlyMentors.ai app now provides real AI-powered mentor responses instead of fallbacks. Ready for production use!"
