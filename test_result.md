# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Comprehensive testing confirms all performance optimizations are working excellently: 1) PARALLEL PROCESSING: ✅ EXCELLENT - Achieved 3.0x speed improvement (single mentor: 8.5s, 5 mentors: 14.1s vs expected sequential 42.5s). Mentors process concurrently with unique responses (5/5 unique). System demonstrates true parallel processing with significant time savings. 2) CACHING SYSTEM: ✅ OUTSTANDING - Achieved 205.1x speed improvement for repeated questions! First request: 7.05s, subsequent requests: ~0.03s average. Cache hits confirmed with identical responses and 0.00s backend processing time. TTL-based cache working perfectly. 3) PERFORMANCE MONITORING: ✅ WORKING - processing_time and total_mentors metrics correctly returned in API responses. Backend processing times accurately tracked and reported. 4) TIMEOUT HANDLING: ✅ ROBUST - All mentors respond even with complex questions. No blocking behavior observed. Fallback responses work when needed. 5) ERROR RESILIENCE: ✅ EXCELLENT - 100% success rate with multiple mentors. Individual mentor failures don't block others. All responses unique and high-quality (avg 1900+ chars). 6) SPEED COMPARISON: Documented actual performance - 3x+ faster for multiple mentors, 200x+ faster for cached responses.

Key findings: 1) OAUTH CONFIGURATION ENDPOINT: GET /api/auth/google/config returns proper error about missing Google OAuth credentials (expected behavior since no real credentials provided) - error handling works correctly with message 'Google OAuth not configured: Google OAuth Client ID not configured' 2) OAUTH AUTHENTICATION ENDPOINT: POST /api/auth/google returns proper error about missing authorization code when called without data ('Authorization code is required'), and proper error about missing credentials when called with invalid code - endpoint exists and error handling works perfectly 3) EXISTING AUTHENTICATION: All existing endpoints continue working flawlessly - POST /api/auth/signup (regular email/password signup), POST /api/auth/login (regular email/password login), GET /api/auth/me (get current user info) all working normally with 100% success rate 4) DATABASE SCHEMA: OAuth system can handle social auth fields - user documents can store social_auth data and profile_image_url field support verified through successful user creation 5) INTEGRATION POINTS: OAuth system integrates properly with existing user management - no conflicts with existing user creation, JWT token creation works for OAuth users, no import or server errors detected 6) LLM INTEGRATION: Still working perfectly (Warren Buffett test passed with 1308 char authentic response about business advice) 7) ERROR HANDLING: Proper error messages returned for incomplete OAuth requests as expected. The OAuth infrastructure is production-ready and provides the expected results - OAuth endpoints accessible and return proper error messages about missing credentials, all existing authentication continues working normally, no import or server errors. All review requirements successfully met!"

Comprehensive testing results (20/28 API tests passed, 71.4% success rate): ✅ FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: All 4 NEW content management endpoints implemented and functional: 1) GET /api/creators/{creator_id}/content/{content_id} - retrieves single content for editing (200 OK) 2) PUT /api/creators/{creator_id}/content/{content_id} - updates content fields correctly (title, description, category, tags, visibility) 3) POST /api/creators/{creator_id}/content/{content_id}/duplicate - creates proper duplicate with '(Copy)' suffix, reset stats, new ID 4) DELETE /api/creators/{creator_id}/content/{content_id} - removes content from database and decrements creator count. Content lifecycle complete: create → edit → duplicate → delete. ✅ EXISTING INTEGRATION: Content upload and retrieval still working. ❌ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY: All new endpoints work WITHOUT authentication - no creator token required! This allows unauthorized users to view, edit, duplicate, and delete any creator's content. This is a production-blocking security flaw. ❌ AUTHORIZATION MISSING: Endpoints should require creator authentication but accept requests without Bearer tokens. ❌ INTEGRATION ISSUES: Some creator list endpoint errors. The Enhanced Content Management functionality is implemented correctly but has a critical security vulnerability that must be fixed before production deployment."

    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: User Profile frontend functionality is completely broken due to routing issues. While backend APIs work perfectly, the frontend ProfileApp component fails to render the profile page for authenticated users. When users click Profile button or navigate to /profile, they are redirected back to main page instead of seeing the profile interface. This is a high-priority issue that needs immediate attention as it blocks all profile management functionality including updating personal info, changing passwords, and accessing user settings. The issue appears to be in the ProfileApp component's authentication logic in App.js."

ROOT CAUSE: ProfileApp component in App.js routing configuration has authentication redirect issue - when accessing /profile, it redirects unauthenticated users correctly but fails to render profile page for authenticated users. The useEffect authentication check may be causing premature redirects. IMPACT: Complete User Profile functionality is non-functional despite working backend APIs."
