<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively managed several complex feature developments and bug fixes for the OnlyMentors.ai platform. Key efforts included implementing a pay-per-view (PPV) content system, which involved creating backend endpoints for file upload, management, and associated frontend components. Significant debugging was required to resolve authentication mismatches (Chat 124) and file upload issues (Chat 152). Following this, a comprehensive mentor tier rating system was introduced, encompassing backend logic, new frontend components, and integration into the Creator Dashboard. Finally, work commenced on implementing mentor type filtering (AI vs. Human) for the main user search, which involved updating backend search logic and frontend UI, but ended with an unresolved frontend empty state issue. The troubleshoot agent was leveraged effectively for critical problem identification and root cause analysis throughout these tasks.

<product_requirements>
The OnlyMentors.ai platform offers an AI-powered subscription service connecting users with AI and human mentors. Its core features include Stripe integration, multi-factor authentication (email, Google, Facebook), a mentor marketplace, and an Administrator Console for comprehensive user/mentor management.

The development focused on:
1.  **Robust User Authentication**: Fixed Google/Facebook OAuth issues, improving signup/login.
2.  **Comprehensive User Profile Data**: Enhanced detailed user information collection during registration (full name, email, phone, communication preferences, credit card for premium).
3.  **Enhanced Admin Console**: Implemented admin features like password reset, user/mentor suspension/deletion, improved UI with first/last name columns, and better table layouts.
4.  **SMS Messaging & 2FA**: Integrated Twilio for user communication and two-factor authentication.
5.  **Database Management**: Provided an admin interface for MongoDB viewing, export, backup, restore, and analytics.
6.  **Pay-Per-View Content System**: Enabled creators to sell content (documents, videos, lessons) for one-time purchases with flexible pricing and revenue sharing.
7.  **Mentor Rating System**: Introduced a tier-based system (New, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Ultimate) based on subscriber count to enhance mentor credibility and motivate growth.
8.  **Mentor Type Filtering**: Began implementing filters for the user search interface to distinguish between AI-only, Human-only, or all mentors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the mentor search functionality in the main application (). The user requested to add filters to distinguish between AI only mentors, Human Mentors only, or All mentors, to be displayed as toggle button pills next to the search bar.

The following has been implemented for this feature:
1.  **Backend Updates ()**: The  endpoint was updated to support  filtering, automatically assigning ai or human based on existing data.
2.  **Frontend Logic ()**:
    *   State variables like  have been introduced to manage the selected filter type.
    *   The  and mentor rendering logic have been updated to incorporate the  when fetching and displaying mentors.
    *   Visual indicators (badges) have been added to mentor cards to clearly show if a mentor is AI or Human, along with their tier for human mentors.
    *   Toggle buttons for 'All', 'AI Mentors', and 'Human Mentors' have been added to the UI next to the search bar.
3.  **Issue**: After implementing the filter, the user reported that clicking Human Mentors displayed no results, even though no error was given. This is because there are currently no verified human creators/mentors in the test system.
4.  **Current Task**: The AI engineer is in the process of adding a helpful empty state message to  that will be displayed when no mentors are found for the selected filter, specifically for the Human Mentors filter. A linting error was encountered () while trying to add this empty state message in .

<optional_next_step>
Fix the linting error in  from  to successfully implement the empty state message for mentor type filtering.
