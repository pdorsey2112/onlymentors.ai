<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved an extensive, iterative process to address complex feature requests and bug fixes for the OnlyMentors.ai platform. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on implementing and subsequently troubleshooting mentor type filtering, which ultimately proved intractable due to persistent React state management issues, leading to its removal. Following this, the engineer successfully implemented podcast upload functionality for both standard and premium content, including backend validation and frontend UI updates. The most recent major initiative, currently in progress, is the development of a multi-tenant business version of the platform, encompassing business inquiry, company registration, employee management, and a dedicated admin console. This work is ongoing with an initial focus on frontend integration. The troubleshoot agent was frequently leveraged to diagnose critical issues and guide architectural changes throughout the development process.
