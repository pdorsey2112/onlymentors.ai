The AI engineer successfully transitioned the OnlyMentors.ai MVP into a robust platform. Key achievements include implementing Facebook Login, significantly optimizing performance (3x faster for multiple mentors, 200x for cached questions), and enforcing a 5-mentor selection limit. A major effort involved refactoring frontend routing to fix the Admin Console login and later addressing a critical user profile logout bug by standardizing authentication state persistence and React Router navigation. Throughout, the engineer debugged complex issues, including external OAuth domain configurations and internal JavaScript errors, demonstrating an iterative, problem-solving approach. The work concluded with the engineer believing they had fixed the mentor public profile view, which the user immediately contradicted, setting the current task.

The OnlyMentors.ai platform is an AI-powered subscription service connecting users with AI-driven mentors across various categories, providing personality-driven wisdom. Users can ask questions, manage subscriptions via Stripe, and authenticate through email or social sign-on. The platform also features an OnlyFans-style mentor grid.

Implemented features include: OpenAI API integration, expanded mentor database (270+ mentors), Stripe subscription management, and a Creator/Mentor marketplace with signup, profile creation, content upload, and dashboards.

Recent focuses involved an Administrator Console for user/mentor management, critical reports, and an AI Integration Framework for content moderation, customer service, sales, and marketing. Enhancements included removing mentor/user count limits, replacing placeholder images with Wikipedia photos, expanding user authentication (Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook), enhanced content management (CRUD), and a user question context retention system. A Forgot Password process was also added for users and mentors. The current task involved implementing Facebook Login, performance optimizations, limiting mentor selection, fixing admin login, and building a user profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing the view public profile for mentor functionality. The user had initially reported that this feature was not working.

The engineer's process for this task involved:
1.  **Investigation:** Examining the mentor card rendering in  and identifying that there was *no existing functionality* to view detailed mentor profiles, only to select mentors for questions.
2.  **Implementation Plan:** Decided to add a View Profile button to mentor cards and create a  component to display comprehensive mentor details (name, title, photo, bio, expertise, achievements, Why Ask? section).
3.  **File Creation/Modification:**
    *   Created  to house the modal's UI and logic.
    *   Modified  to:
        *   Add state management for showing/hiding the .
        *   Add handlers () to open the modal with specific mentor data.
        *   Integrate the  component into the main application's JSX.
        *   Add a View Profile button to each mentor card, which triggers the modal.
4.  **Initial Testing:** The engineer performed frontend tests, and believed the functionality was successfully implemented, reporting that mentor profile viewing was working perfectly.

However, the user's very next message directly contradicted this, stating: view public profile for mentor does not work.! Do not charge me for the fix!!.

The AI engineer has just acknowledged this critical feedback, apologized for the misdiagnosis, and is currently in the process of re-investigating the mentor card rendering and actual issue for a fix. The current state is that the mentor profile viewing functionality is *thought to be implemented* but is *not working* for the user, and the engineer is debugging it again.

<optional_next_step>
Debug and fix the view public profile for mentor functionality as reported by the user.
