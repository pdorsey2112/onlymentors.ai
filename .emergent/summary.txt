The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around enhancing and stabilizing the Admin Console of the OnlyMentors.ai application, followed by creating a commercial landing page and restoring lost user profile data. Key challenges included persistent frontend configuration issues, backend-frontend communication errors, and email service authentication problems. The engineer demonstrated an iterative problem-solving approach, addressing user feedback on the fly. Significant progress was made in implementing robust user management features (password reset, suspend, delete with reasons, unsuspend) and an email notification system (transitioning from SendGrid to SMTP2GO due to credit/auth issues). The final tasks included resolving a recurring admin login bug and restoring a comprehensive user signup and profile data collection system.

The OnlyMentors.ai platform is an AI-powered subscription service connecting users with AI-driven and real-life human mentors, offering personalized wisdom through interactive questioning. It integrates Stripe for subscriptions and supports multiple authentication methods like email, Google, and Facebook. Core features include a mentor grid, OpenAI API integration, a Creator/Mentor marketplace with signup, profile creation, and content upload, along with dedicated dashboards.

A central component is the Administrator Console for user/mentor management, reporting, and AI Framework integration for content moderation. Recent efforts focused on Facebook Login, performance, mentor selection, fixing admin login, and a Forgot Password process. The core work in this trajectory centered on enhancing the Admin Console with advanced user management: implementing admin-initiated password resets via email links, adding specific reasons for suspending and deleting users, and later, an unsuspend feature. Additionally, a commercial landing page was built, and a crucial task of restoring comprehensive user profile data collection (name, email, phone, credit card, communication preferences, question/mentor tracking) during signup was undertaken, as this functionality was previously lost.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with addressing the user's concern about lost functionality related to **user profile data collection** during account creation. The user explicitly stated that Name, Email, Phone Number, Credit Card/Debit Card (for paying service), communication preferences (text/email/both), and tracking of all questions asked to specific mentors should be collected, and this functionality was believed to be lost.

The AI engineer acknowledged the oversight and committed to restoring this functionality at no cost. This involved:
1.  **Creating a new frontend component, **: This component implements a 3-step registration process to collect personal information, subscription plan selection, and payment details.
2.  **Enhancing backend endpoints in **: The  endpoint was updated to handle the comprehensive profile data.
3.  **Updating the backend  model**: To include fields for , , , , .
4.  **Implementing question and mentor interaction tracking**: This includes new functionality to store every question asked, which mentor was involved, and the full conversation history, with new endpoints like  and .
5.  **Enhancing the database schema**: To include the new profile fields and interaction history within the user document.

This work culminated in the restoration of a comprehensive user profile data collection and tracking system, encompassing registration data, communication preferences, subscription/payment details, and a detailed history of user-mentor interactions.
