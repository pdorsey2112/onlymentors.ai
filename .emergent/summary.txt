The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a challenging journey in stabilizing and extending the OnlyMentors.ai application, primarily focusing on the Admin Console. Initially, efforts were directed towards fixing a view public profile bug, which quickly devolved into persistent frontend caching and deployment issues, leading to the deletion of the . A major pivot occurred with the user's request to repurpose a Profile button to Logoff, successfully implemented via direct DOM manipulation, bypassing the core build problems.

The primary focus then shifted to implementing advanced admin user management. This involved extensive debugging of frontend rendering issues (React version incompatibility,  access errors, CSS compilation failures due to invalid selectors) and backend network/proxy misconfigurations. The engineer iteratively resolved these, ultimately discovering that  (using inline styles) was the stable version, rather than the intended  (using Tailwind CSS).

The most recent work involved enhancing the now-functional  to include user management actions (reset password, suspend, delete), adding a backend endpoint for password reset, and refining the frontend UI with a dropdown for reset reasons. A recurring session persistence issue upon tab navigation remains a known minor bug.

<product_requirements>
The OnlyMentors.ai platform is an AI-powered subscription service designed to connect users with AI-driven mentors, providing personality-driven wisdom through interactive questioning. The platform supports Stripe subscriptions and multiple authentication methods, including email and social sign-on (Google, Facebook). Key functionalities include an OnlyFans-style mentor grid, integration with the OpenAI API, an expanded mentor database, and a comprehensive Creator/Mentor marketplace. This marketplace features signup flows, profile creation, content upload capabilities, and dedicated dashboards for creators.

A critical component of the application is the Administrator Console, which provides tools for managing users and mentors, generating reports, and integrating with an AI Framework for content moderation, customer service, sales, and marketing. Recent development efforts have specifically focused on implementing Facebook Login, optimizing performance, refining mentor selection limits, fixing admin login issues, developing a user profile page, and establishing a Forgot Password process. The ongoing work centers on enhancing the Administrator Console with advanced user management features.

Immediately before this summary request, the focus was entirely on stabilizing and enhancing the **Admin Console**. The primary goal was to get the admin dashboard to display correctly and then implement specific user management functionalities.

Initially, the AI engineer struggled with:
1.  **Frontend Rendering Issues**: The React application, including the admin console, was showing blank pages due to a mix of React version incompatibility (React 19 vs. dependencies needing 18), and widespread direct access to  in various components, which became  after configuration changes.
2.  **Network/Proxy Configuration**: Repeated Network error, Invalid Host header, and ECONNREFUSED issues arose from conflicts between frontend  configuration,  proxy settings, and  proxy. The backend URL was dynamically determined, leading to further debugging.
3.  **CSS Styling Issues**: The admin dashboard was visually broken, with elements scattered. This was traced to invalid CSS selectors in  breaking Tailwind CSS compilation.

The **breakthrough** came from:
1.  **React Downgrade**: Downgrading React to 18.3.1 resolved core dependency conflicts.
2.  **Environment Variable Handling**: Systematically fixing  references across , , OAuth components, Creator components, and others, by routing them through a new  utility.
3.  **CSS Fix**: Removing the invalid CSS selectors from , which restored proper Tailwind CSS functionality for the main application and login forms.
4.  **Admin Dashboard Component Selection**: Crucially, it was discovered that  (which uses inline styles) was the correctly functioning and styled admin dashboard, rather than  (which relies on Tailwind). The  was configured to use .

Following the stabilization of the admin console's display and access, the immediate work focused on implementing specific user management actions within the :
1.  **Actions Column**: Added a new Actions column to the user table.
2.  **Action Buttons**: Integrated Reset Password, Suspend, and Delete buttons for each user.
3.  **Reset Password Enhancement**: The Reset Password functionality was enhanced with a modal dialog requiring the admin to select a reason from a dropdown list (Customer Service, Internal User, Admin).
4.  **Backend Endpoint Creation**: A new backend API endpoint, , was added to . This endpoint generates a temporary password, updates the user record, and logs the action.

At the point of the summary request, the AI engineer had just confirmed that the newly created backend endpoint for password reset is working correctly, and the frontend modal with the dropdown reasons for password reset is also implemented and integrated into the  component. The user's query about original passwords for test user is the immediate next action. A minor session persistence issue (reverting to login when clicking tabs) remains a known bug.

The next step is to provide the original passwords for the test users from the  file, as requested by the user.
