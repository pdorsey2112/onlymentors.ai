The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative problem-solving process marred by persistent frontend deployment and caching issues. Initially tasked with fixing a view public profile for mentor bug, the engineer first attempted a modal-based solution, which triggered an Avatar is not defined error. Despite extensive debugging, cache clearing, and even direct source code modifications, the underlying caching problem prevented any permanent frontend fixes, leading to user frustration. A pivotal shift occurred when the user suggested re-purposing the Profile button to a Logoff action, which was successfully implemented using direct DOM manipulation, bypassing the persistent build issues. The engineer then applied this Logoff change to the Creator Dashboard's header button and restored the View Public Profile tab. The trajectory concludes with the engineer initiating the implementation of advanced admin user management features, beginning with backend database and API enhancements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing advanced user management features within the Admin Console. This initiative follows a detailed plan encompassing both backend and frontend modifications to empower administrators with the ability to manage user roles (user, mentor, admin), suspend, and delete user accounts.

On the **backend**, the engineer:
1.  **Modified **: Introduced  and  enums, along with  and  Pydantic models. This provides the necessary data structures for managing user roles and statuses.
2.  **Updated **:
    *   Imported the newly defined Pydantic models and enums.
    *   Enhanced the  endpoint to include  and  information in the user listing.
    *   Added three new dedicated API endpoints for admin actions:
        *   : To change a user's role.
        *   : To suspend or unsuspend a user.
        *   : To perform a soft deletion of a user account.

On the **frontend**, the engineer has begun integrating these new capabilities into the Admin Console:
1.  **Created **: This new React component is designed to house the UI for user listing and management controls.
2.  **Modified **: The engineer has started the process of integrating  into the , preparing to add a new tab specifically for user management.

The current state is that the backend API for user management is set up, and the new  component has been created, with initial steps taken to integrate it into the . The engineer is in the process of defining where exactly to place the new user management tab within the Admin Dashboard's navigation.
