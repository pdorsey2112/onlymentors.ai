The AI engineer's work involved an extensive, iterative process to address complex feature requests for the OnlyMentors.ai platform, primarily focusing on building out the multi-tenant Business Version. Key accomplishments include implementing podcast upload functionality, a comprehensive business admin console with integrated admin features (excluding payouts/financials), and a robust category management system for AI and human mentors. Significant effort was also directed towards debugging authentication flows, particularly for business admin users, by fixing database connection and schema issues. Most recently, the engineer successfully developed dynamic, business-specific landing pages. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach, iteratively building and debugging, culminating in a functional multi-tenant framework.

The OnlyMentors.ai platform is an AI-powered subscription service connecting users with AI and human mentors, featuring Stripe integration, multi-factor authentication, a mentor marketplace, and an Admin Console. Recent development focused on:
1.  **Robust User Authentication**: Fixing Google/Facebook OAuth and improving signup/login.
2.  **Comprehensive User Profile Data**: Enhancing user information collection.
3.  **Enhanced Admin Console**: Implementing password reset, user/mentor management, UI improvements, and database management.
4.  **SMS Messaging & 2FA**: Integrating Twilio for communication and security.
5.  **Database Management**: Providing an admin interface for MongoDB operations.
6.  **Pay-Per-View Content System**: Enabling creators to sell content with flexible pricing.
7.  **Mentor Rating System**: Introducing subscriber-count-based tiers for credibility.
8.  **Mentor Type Filtering (Attempted then Removed)**: Initially aimed to distinguish between AI-only, Human-only, or all mentors in the user search, but this feature was ultimately removed due to persistent issues.
9.  **Podcast Uploads**: Human mentors can upload podcast files (mp3, aac, m4a, wav) to both standard and premium content sections, with appropriate backend validation and frontend file type acceptance.
10. **Business Version of Platform**: Creation of a multi-tenant platform for businesses, allowing them to add their own mentors, select AI mentors, manage content, track usage by department, and utilize a dedicated business admin console. This includes white-label landing pages, custom category management, and a no-revenue-share model for business-specific mentors/users.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed **Phase 5: Business Landing Page Integration** for the OnlyMentors.ai multi-tenant business platform. This pivotal phase involved creating dynamic, business-specific landing pages (e.g., ) that serve as branded entry points for each company.

The work for Phase 5 included:
1.  ** Creation**: A new React component was developed to render these dynamic landing pages.
2.  **Backend Public APIs**: New unauthenticated API endpoints were added to  to fetch business-specific information, categories, and assigned mentors for display on these public landing pages.
3.  **Company Slug Integration**: A  field was added to company records in the database, used for generating unique, readable URLs (e.g., ).
4.  **Dynamic Frontend Routing**:  was updated to include a dynamic route () that directs requests to the new  component, enabling URL-based business detection and content loading.

This successfully established the branded entry points for each business, showcasing their mentors organized by the newly implemented category system. This builds upon previous work that integrated admin console features into the business console, implemented category management, and enabled mentor-category assignments. The current state allows for a white-label, multi-tenant platform where businesses have their own branded landing page and an integrated admin console for management.
